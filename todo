Is my fetch in a proper call space? If someone didn't go to index first it wouldn't work

In FighterShow not sure why passing {fighter} instead of props

Be able to filter the index page

Ability to pull a gyms fighters and put them on page

add descritption and image to fighter and gym

why aren't there like good docs on ui's

navbar border won't show

changed logo size?

When my app rerenders when i Make a change show page breaks

Can't freaking center the semantic ui and it screws up my freaking nav bar

Validations

associate gym with fighter
