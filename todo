Is my fetch in a proper call space? If someone didn't go to index first it wouldn't work

weird it doesn't autoselect flyweight on fighter form

alert errors fetch

why aren't there like good docs on ui's

navbar border won't show

changed logo size?

When my app rerenders when i Make a change show page breaks

Can't freaking center the semantic ui and it screws up my freaking nav bar
