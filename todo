Is my fetch in a proper call space? If someone didn't go to index first it wouldn't work

Be able to filter the index page... Have it sorted by weight class

Ability to pull a gyms fighters and put them on page... Can do has many but says that not proper.. Can't do has_many
-- find fighters by gym_id

add image to fighter and gym

why aren't there like good docs on ui's

navbar border won't show

changed logo size?

When my app rerenders when i Make a change show page breaks

Can't freaking center the semantic ui and it screws up my freaking nav bar

Validations

associate gym with fighter -- pass down gyms in props

could i make another variable in reducer to hold the id for the redirect to show page after creation

const fighter = props.fighter.find(fighter => fighter.id === props.match.params.fighterId)


just image URL
